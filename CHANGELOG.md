## [1.1.0-rc2] - 2019-05-19
### Added
- A new [NetVips.Native](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NetVips.Native/) package containing the pre-compiled libvips binaries for Linux, macOS and Windows ([#21](https://github.com/kleisauke/net-vips/issues/21)).
  - Changes to the [NetVips.Native.*](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=id%3ANetVips.Native) packages will be documented [here](CHANGELOG.native.md).
- Add `NetVips.GetSuffixes()` to get a list of all the filename suffixes supported by libvips ([libvips/ruby-vips#186](https://github.com/libvips/ruby-vips/issues/186)).
- Add support for progress feedback (`image.SetProgress()`) and signal handling (`image.SignalConnect()`) ([#31](https://github.com/kleisauke/net-vips/issues/31)).
- Add `image.SetKill()` and `image.IsKilled()` ([#31](https://github.com/kleisauke/net-vips/issues/31), [libvips/libvips@91d0e7e](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/commit/91d0e7e3d06fe6293f8e7513f30fd21585ea4305)).
- Add `NetVips.ProfileSet()`, `NetVips.VectorSet()`, `NetVips.ConcurrencySet()` and `NetVips.ConcurrencyGet()` utilities.
- Add support for loading and saving from and to streams (`Image.NewFromStream()` / `image.WriteToStream()`) ([#33](https://github.com/kleisauke/net-vips/issues/33)).

### Changed
- Improve memory management ([#26](https://github.com/kleisauke/net-vips/issues/26)).

- The overloadable operators `==` and `!=` have been changed to `Equal` and `NotEqual` to avoid conflicts with `null` checks.
- Some methods are overloaded instead of defining the parameters as `object` type.
- The base class was renamed from `Base` to `NetVips` to comply with the C# code conventions.
